# the-study-of-spillover-effect-with-DCC-GARCH-model-in-R-programming
This R code shows the data process of the paper published in February 2018 on Energy Economics, named as Oil volatility, oil and gas ﬁrms and portfolio diversiﬁcation. This paper uses DCC-GARCH to to identify the transmission mechanisms of volatility shocks and the contagion of volatility among oil prices and stock prices of oil and gas companies, respectively. The data is open resourced on https://sites.google.com/view/davidgabauer/econometric-code, who is also one of the authors of this paper. I also refer some of the R codes from his coding.
